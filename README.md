First, I defined the student class, its contents, methods and properties
Then define the course class as well its properties and required methods.
in course class function to add new student It checks if we have reached Max Capacity, it will run Bush, and if we have reached Max, it will return False.
in course class function to drop student I want to make a loop around the list  for the students, and if I reach the student I want to remove, I will work to shorten the string where I did reach.
Then create a class University, and create an object of type Student and another type of Course.
in university class functions to add a student, add a course, and function to register the student in the available course
    I will check to see if the course is available and if the student is able to enroll in it
    If yes, I will make a registration, if no, I will return false, Student drop from the course
   The same method as checking registration in a course.
    in university class A report to first display the code for each available course, its title, and which course the student wants to enroll in
    It displays the student who registered for this course.
    Finally, in the main function, I created 3 objects from a student and 2 objects from a course, giving them values.
They were added to the university.
Each student registers or withdraws from the course as required.
I deleted them after I finished.
